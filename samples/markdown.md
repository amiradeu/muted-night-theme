# Markdown Overview

A text can be **bold** and it can also be _italicized_. Sometimes it can also be ~~strikethrough~~.

You can make task list:

1. First, wash the vegetables.
2. Second, cook em' with olive oil.
3. Enjoy the food.

You can also make a bullet list:

-   Bell pepper
-   Noodles
-   Coca-cola
-   Ice cream

> A wise _**man**_ once said something, but it could have also been a _**woman**_.
> So just put it here. People will relate it to something.

Several sustainable stores I want to buy from:

-   [] [Everlane](https://everlane.com)
-   [] [Veja](https://veja.com)
-   [] [Tsuki Market](https://tsuki.market)
-   [x] [Etiko](https://etiko.com)

\* Without the backslash, this would be a bullet in an unordered list.

Code
`this is a code print("hello world")`
